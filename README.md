# Ninth Circle
**Unity Game Development Project for COMP 376 at Concordia University**

A first-person action game developed as a team project over the course of several months. Ninth Circle was created in under a month as a Final Project submission, featuring complex boss battles, weapon systems, and magical talismans.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Ninth Circle is a challenging first-person action game where players battle through waves of enemies and face off against powerful bosses. The game features a comprehensive weapon system, magical talismans, and dynamic environmental hazards.
